# Sentiment-Analysis
In this project Sentiment Analysis was applied to the IMDB dataset in order to detect whether a sentence is classified as either positive or negative. 
Sentiment Analysis was implemented by using three different classifiers and the results were compared in order to determine the best classifier.
The 3 techniques that were used was the Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Classifier and the Logistic Regression Classifier.
